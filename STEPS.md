# Steps

One entry per step. Write the hypothesis and expected fixes **before** running the eval.

### Step 0 · Baseline

Agent: table/column names from `information_schema` + `run_sql` + `submit_answer`.
No docs, no metric definitions, no business rules.

Hypothesis: it answers simple counts but fails on metric definitions (revenue with vs without
tax), table grain (supplies fan-out), time ("last quarter" vs data ending Aug 2025), entities
(stores with no orders) and unanswerable questions.
